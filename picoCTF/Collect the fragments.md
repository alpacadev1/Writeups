# Challenge:
Description
Identify and connect to 4 open ports on the target system. Each successful connection will reveal part of the flag. The flag seems too long, though. Can you write a Python script that is able to decode the flag and saves it with the appropriate extension?

* From here I decided to put all these encoded parts into a .txt file where I can concencate all encoded parts into one large string
* One thing I noticed was "iVBORw0KGgo" which is the telltale sign that this base64 is likely represents a PNG image
* On that note, I decided to visit this website: https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image. On here, I simply copy pasted the base64 and converted it to an image
* The image was the flag!
