# Challenge
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here.
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 59182

# Work:
* So, reviewing the code, I came across something interesting in the data_read() function

* In this code, if the entry number equals 0, it will print the flag
```

* In the code above, some data HAD to be passed into the database, so I included some filler "A's" to pass that requirement.
* Later, I input 0, and this printed the flag!
